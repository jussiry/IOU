// `tally-canonical-schnorr-v1` authorship proof so the new verification path
// (`verifyTallyAuthorship`) accepts already-stored ledger entries and queued
// outbox messages — that path reads `authorship.signature`, never the top-level
// field, once a proof exists.
//
// We intentionally leave the raw top-level `signature` in place rather than
// deleting it. Nothing in the current code reads it anymore, but two older
// readers still verify via it: (1) a rolled-back app build that predates
// `authorship` (it loads a v4 blob but can't run this migration), and (2) an
// un-upgraded peer that receives our pre-migration entries during sync. Note
// this is only partial back-compat — entries we author *after* upgrading carry
// no top-level signature at all, so old readers already can't verify those. A
// later (v5) migration can drop the field once the pre-authorship build and any
// un-upgraded peers are fully retired.
