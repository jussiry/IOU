/*
 * pages.js — the ordered index of every page in the Design site.
 *
 * This is the one piece of shared state across the standalone HTML pages: it
 * lets design.js build the same sidebar table of contents on every page without
 * each page having to list its siblings. Defined as a plain global (not fetched)
 * so the site works when opened directly from disk (file://) as well as served.
 *
 * Each entry: { href, title, status, group }. `status` uses the site
 * convention — implemented | planned | proposal | reference. An entry with no
 * `group` (Overview) sits at the very top, always visible. Groups are the
 * project's anatomy; the first page in each is its authored intro, followed by
 * the pages that fill it in.
 *
 * The TIP pages are generated from TIPs/*.md by design/scripts/build-docs.mjs —
 * re-run it after those change and keep the entries below in sync with its
 * output. Every other page, the imported spec and plan ones included, is
 * authored HTML edited directly in design/.
